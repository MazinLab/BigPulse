A high power avalanche mode laser driver

For fully isolated use, cut the jumper on the bottom, do not populate the boost converter and supply 200V and 12V to each side seperately

For use without ground isolation do not populate anything on the bottom other than the sense resistors and supply 12V through the barrel jack
